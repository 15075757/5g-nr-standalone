# 5G Standalone Registration

Standalone Access Registration is the process by which a device registers with a 5G network to gain access to its services. It involves various registration procedures, messages, and security measures to ensure authorized access and mutual authentication.

The "5G-NR RRC Connection Setup" sequence describes the steps involved in setting up a radio connection between a User Equipment (UE) and a 5G Node B (gNB). The sequence includes actions and messages exchanged between the UE and the gNB, such as the transmission of a preamble, allocation of temporary and dedicated Radio Network Temporary Identifiers (RNTIs), exchange of various control messages (Random Access Response, RRC Setup Request, RRC Setup Complete), and the setup of signaling and radio bearers. The ultimate goal of the sequence is to establish a radio connection and bring the UE into the "RRC_CONNECTED" state, allowing the UE to access the 5G network.
